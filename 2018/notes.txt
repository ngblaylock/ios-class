Basic iOS
    Overall Feedback
    - Only talk about 2-3 Apps a day
    - Go really slow.
    - They didn't recognize when you switched apps.

    Monday, Navigation
    - Don't start off with the website. It scares them
    - When you do show them the website, use the computer, not the iOS device
    - Don't show them how to add the slides to the homescreen
    - Let them know that they probably have a hard time getting on the internet, and there could be a hundred reasons why so not to worry because we don't need the internet for this first day
    - End talking about the slides
    - They liked the idea of navigation is the most important

    Tuesday, Phone and Messages
    - They loved this day on using the phone and texting
    - Consider a few more examples. Have someone there to help present on the other end of the line

    Wednesday, Settings
    - Lots of compliments
    - Just talk about the control center and Settings
    - Didn't get to App Store which is fine
    - Student gave me a laser pointer to use and it hleped a lot of people
    - Make sure they understand why they need to know a setting
    - Be sure to cover larger text size, magnifier, and keeping the phone screen on

    Thursday, Productivity
    - Safari was way too advanced for about half the class. They kept saying that they were lost, but I still don't know why. Consider putting Safari in the Intermediate Class
    - After class there were a lot of people who I saw who had dozens of tabs opened and they didn't know what they were for.
    - We covered way too much materials. Keep it to 3 simple apps or 2 bigger apps (similar to the phone, messages, and contacts apps).
    - Maybe do Photos, Notes, and Calendar
    
    Friday, Class Choice
    - Finished talking about the Calendar. Took it slow and it went well.
    - Talked about the Health App, but specifically how to add the Emergency ID. It was very useful tool. I didn't go into every detail which I think helped the class.
    - A lot of people said that they would take my next classes
    

All About Apps

    Monday, App Store
    - Went really well. I talked only about what apps are, how to navigate through the app store, and how to rearange, delete, close, and exit apps. Did better at distinguishing between ipad and iphone. Some people looked a little bored, but for the most part people were very interested and asked good questions.
