# Summer Citizens iOS Class Teacher Notes

---

## Basic iOS

### Overall Feedback
- Only talk about 2-3 Apps a day
- Go really slow.
- They didn't recognize when you switched apps.

### Monday, Navigation
- Don't start off with the website. It scares them
- When you do show them the website, use the computer, not the iOS device
- Don't show them how to add the slides to the homescreen
- Let them know that they probably have a hard time getting on the internet, and there could be a hundred reasons why so not to worry because we don't need the internet for this first day
- End talking about the slides
- They liked the idea of navigation is the most important

### Tuesday, Phone and Messages
- They loved this day on using the phone and texting
- Consider a few more examples. Have someone there to help present on the other end of the line

### Wednesday, Settings
- Lots of compliments
- Just talk about the control center and Settings
- Didn't get to App Store which is fine
- Student gave me a laser pointer to use and it hleped a lot of people
- Make sure they understand why they need to know a setting
- Be sure to cover larger text size, magnifier, and keeping the phone screen on

### Thursday, Productivity
- Safari was way too advanced for about half the class. They kept saying that they were lost, but I still don't know why. Consider putting Safari in the Intermediate Class
- After class there were a lot of people who I saw who had dozens of tabs opened and they didn't know what they were for.
- We covered way too much materials. Keep it to 3 simple apps or 2 bigger apps (similar to the phone, messages, and contacts apps).
- Maybe do Photos, Notes, and Calendar

### Friday, Class Choice
- Finished talking about the Calendar. Took it slow and it went well.
- Talked about the Health App, but specifically how to add the Emergency ID. It was very useful tool. I didn't go into every detail which I think helped the class.
- A lot of people said that they would take my next classes

## All About Apps

### Overall Feedback

### Monday, App Store
- Went really well. I talked only about what apps are, how to navigate through the app store, and how to rearange, delete, close, and exit apps. Did better at distinguishing between ipad and iphone.
- Some people looked a little bored, but for the most part people were very interested and asked good questions.
- I didn't start off with my website, which helped not confuse people. I did tell them about it, but just showed 'ios.nathanblaylock.com' on the page so they could write it down, then I showed them the page and what is on it.

### Tuesday, Communication
- Show the Slack commercial
- I talked about phone, messages, facetime, and find your friends and also some popular alternatives.
- I think it is important to talk about alternatives because not everyone has an apple device.
- There was a lot of engagement and everyone seemed to be on track and interested. Many thanked me for the class.
- It was important to demonstrate why you would want to use one over another. One man said that he wish he would have known about some of the apps a few years ago to save money.

### Wednesday, Productivity
- Chatbooks video, the class was laughing the whole time
- Talk about cloud storage, files app, documents, spreadsheets, presentations, browsers, and mail.
- Many people found that this day was very informative. A lot still had a lot of questions about cloud storage and how to use it with their computer. I told them that I was going to cover that in my intermediate iOS class.
- Students shared apps at the beginning which had a great conversation.

### Thursday, Entertainment
- Show the Lego AR video

### Friday, Education, Class Choice
- Show Apples commercial for iPad for Education
- Star Gazing App
